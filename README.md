# Leetcode
My personal repository for all completed leetcodes from [Leetcode] (https://leetcode.com/) site. Most of the problems, that I solved, were for interview preparation and general programming practicing, but some I did just for fun. All challenges are completed in C/C++, since it is my main language, along with usage of templates and STL library. Each leetcode has described task inside of file by comments for utility and more comfortable reviewing. I did not add most trivial and mt first leetcodes due to their simplicity and commonplace. Repository will be update often, actually with each and every completed leetcode. It is separated by the difficulty of challanges.
